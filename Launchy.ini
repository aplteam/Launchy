; This path:
path2ride   =   'C:\Users\[you]\AppData\Local\Programs\Dyalog\RIDE'
; refers to the default installation directory for Ride when `[you]` will be replaced by `⎕AN` at runtime. 
; All installed main versions (like 3.0, 3.1 and 4.0) are going into the "File" menu.
; You need to specify a different path only if you have decided to install Ride in a non-default location.
; If several sub versions (say 3.0.1234 and 3.0.9876) are installed then Launchy determines the "best" version (3.0.9876 in our example) automatically.
