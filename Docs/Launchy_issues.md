# Launchy issues

## To be investigated


* Launchy's "Update" function works in dev but not in the Runtime EXE
* Launchy should support Dyalog's "new" patch/update mechanism
* It appears that every time Launchy is updated the general INI file is overwritten
* Information provided by Launchy in case it cannot find an INI file is not complete

----

## Done

* Change handling of command line parms 
* "Ask for a Ride" results in a mutilated (nested) command line
* When editing an INI file, Ctrl+S provides an invalid file name
* Font size specified in INI file is not honoured
