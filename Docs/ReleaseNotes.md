# Launchy Release Notes

## 6.0.0 from 2019-05-16

* Launchy now has an installer.
* Plenty of minor improvements.
* Bug fixes: #18, #19, #15, #14, #13 and #16.

If you upgrade from an earlier version to 6.0.0 then carry out the following steps:

1. Install Launchy with its installer.

1. Compare the INI file from the old version with the new one in order to save your amendments.

   (Skip this step in case you are sure that you did not change/add anything to the INI file)

1. Remove the earlier version from your machine.
