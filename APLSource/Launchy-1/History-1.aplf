 History
⍝ * 6.3.2
⍝   * The options `stop_in_setup` and `exec_setup` were not handled correctly.\\
⍝     Note that Launchy cannot specify them as flags because in versions prior to 17.1 the interpretation of the
⍝     command line was buggy. In order to overcome those issues the hyphen cannot be used to indicate a flag.
